Implementation of a thermo-mechanically coupled model for NiTi shape memory alloys under force or displacement control

For more details of the coupled model, readers are referred to the journal article: [Timescale competition dictates thermo-mechanical responses of NiTi shape memory alloy bars](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2020.02.021). 

If you are going to use the model and codes, please do not forget to cite our paper.
